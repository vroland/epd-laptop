# Introduction
This TrackPoint library is used to interface with a TrackPoint module 
that is available on most ThinkPad keyboards. It can also be used as a 
general purpose PS/2 mouse library.

Library supports stream mode using interrupt.

Tested with an Arduino Leopard. Solution compiled in Visual Micro, but 
can also be opened with Arduino IDE.

Circuit: a ThinkPad T60 TrackPoint module (ripped from broken keyboard)
connected to an Arduino Leopard. See comments in .ino for more connection
information.
